# CA4
In CA4, we’re going to use Ansible to provision and manage the configurations for our VMs in an automated, scalable way, ensuring best practices for security and maintainability. Here’s a guide with justifications for each step taken to convert our improved CA3 Part 2 setup to use Ansible in CA4.
## Before
On CA3 we had multiple steps with errors that were fixed this week. Comparing to CA3 part2, we are changing the provisioner to Ansible. Regarding the provider for vagrant we used Vmware (Mac) or VirtualBox depending on the machine we were executing.
## Implementing Ansible
### Ansible Inevntory Setup
- **Goal:** Define our hosts in an Ansible inventory file, which is necessary for managing multiple servers.
- **Justification:** The inventory file allows Ansible to target each VM specifically, ensuring that tasks are organized for host1 (app VM) and host2 (db VM).

For this a **hosts.ini** file was created
````
[host1]
192.168.138.144 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_private_key_file=./my_vagrant_key

[host2]
192.168.138.143 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_private_key_file=./my_vagrant_key
````
This file specifies the IPs or hostnames for each VM, SSH users, and private keys. By using custom SSH keys, we maintain secure access.

### Playbook for Setting Up the Application and Database
- **Goal:** Use Ansible to deploy and configure the Building REST Services with Spring application on host1 and the H2 database in server mode on host2.
- **Justification:** Ansible ensures consistency and repeatability, so if the configuration or deployment fails, you can re-run the playbooks without unintended changes.

Created **host1_playbook.yml** and **host2_playbook.yml** Ansible playbooks

````

- **Java Installation:** Both the Spring application and H2 database require Java, so installing it on both VMs ensures compatibility.
- **Spring Application Deployment:** Using copy for the application JAR file allows us to customize the properties and manage them easily.
- **Database Server Mode:** Starting H2 in server mode makes it accessible over the network.

### PAM Configuration for Password Complexity
- **Goal:** Enforce a password complexity policy on both VMs.
- **Justification:** By configuring PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) with Ansible, we enforce security requirements for all users, aligning with standard password policies.

Created **pam_playbook.yml**
````
- name: Configure PAM for password complexity
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install PAM
      apt:
        name: libpam-pwquality
        state: present

    - name: Set minimum password length to 12
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/security/pwquality.conf
        regexp: '^#?minlen='
        line: 'minlen=12'
        state: present

    - name: Require at least 1 uppercase letter
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/security/pwquality.conf
        regexp: '^#?ucredit='
        line: 'ucredit=-1'
        state: present

    - name: Require at least 1 lowercase letter
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/security/pwquality.conf
        regexp: '^#?lcredit='
        line: 'lcredit=-1'
        state: present

    - name: Require at least 1 digit
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/security/pwquality.conf
        regexp: '^#?dcredit='
        line: 'dcredit=-1'
        state: present

    - name: Require at least 1 special character
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/security/pwquality.conf
        regexp: '^#?ocredit='
        line: 'ocredit=-1'
        state: present
````
### User and Group Configuration
- **Goal:** Create a developers group and a devuser user on both VMs, with restricted access to directories.
- **Justification:** Defining user roles and restricting access to sensitive directories follows security best practices, ensuring only authorized users have access.

Created **user_management.yml**
````
- name: Create developers group and devuser on both hosts
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Create 'developers' group
      group:
        name: developers
        state: present

    - name: Create 'devuser' user
      user:
        name: devuser
        group: developers
        create_home: yes
        state: present

    - name: Set up application directory on host1 (REST service)
      file:
        path: /opt/spring-app
        state: directory
        owner: devuser
        group: developers
        mode: '0750'
      when: inventory_hostname == "host1"

    - name: Set up database directory on host2 (H2 database)
      file:
        path: /opt/h2-database
        state: directory
        owner: devuser
        group: developers
        mode: '0750'
      when: inventory_hostname == "host2"
````
### Firewall Rules
- **Goal:** Restrict access to the H2 database so only the Spring app VM can connect.
- **Justification:** Adding ufw rules limits access to the database, preventing unauthorized connections and enhancing security.

On **host2_playbook.yml**
````
- name: Allow SSH on port 22
      ufw:
        rule: allow
        port: '22'
        proto: tcp

    - name: Allow traffic on port 9095 from the app VM's IP
      ufw:
        rule: allow
        from_ip: "192.168.138.144"
        port: '9095'

    - name: Enable UFW firewall
      ufw:
        state: enabled
````
### Ensuring Idempotency
- **Goal:** Ensure all tasks are idempotent, meaning they won’t cause unintended changes if re-run.
- **Justification:** dempotency is crucial for Ansible playbooks in production environments, allowing safe re-runs without changing the desired state.

Examples used:
- **Ensure specific states**

For packages and services we used 
````
 state: present
````
- **Error Handling:** Although we did not use, we could implement the **failed_when** to prevent failing the playbook for specific error or **ignore_errors** to ignore them.

### Summary
This setup ensures a structured and secure deployment process with Ansible, building on the initial improved Vagrant setup from CA3 Part 2. 
By separating configurations into specific playbooks and tasks, we enforce modularity, which aids in troubleshooting and enables selective re-runs if any service or configuration needs adjustment.
